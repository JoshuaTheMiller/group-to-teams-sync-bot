## Important Commands

```sh
# Run the application in "dev" mode and watch for changes
npm start
# Generate models from the openapi definition
npm run openapi
```

## Configuration File

This service/Action requires that a configuration file be present in the `.github` repository of your GitHub Organization. An example of this is show below:

Filename: `team-sync-options.yaml`
```yaml
# This property is used to control the addition of general Members to your Organization.
OrganizationMembersGroup: Some_Group_To_Sync_For_Organization_Membership
# This property is used for syncing all other GitHub Teams. Please note that users must also be a part of the `OrganizationMembersGroup` for the synchronization of the teams below to function properly.
GitHubTeamNames:
- Some_Team_To_Sync
- Some_Other_Team_To_Sync
```

## Necessary configuration of the tool/service

As of this writing, this sync tool can be ran as a standalone app, or as a GitHub Action.

### As a Standalone App

An Azure AD App registration must be created with the following permissions:

* **Application** Permission: `GroupMember.Read.All`
* **Application** Permission: `User.Read.All`

The Client ID and Client Secret must be provided as environment variables to the application.

A GitHub App registration must be created with the following permissions (this information should be moved to an `app.yml file` instead of being documented here):

* Repository- Contents: Read (only necessary for the `.github` repository)
* Repository- Deployments: Read and Write (only necessary for the `.github` repository)
* Organization- Members: Read and Write
* Organization- Administration: Read and Write
    * This is needed for managing [Security Managers](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/orgs/security-managers?apiVersion=2022-11-28), though as Security Managers is in beta, this permission may also change.
    * ‚ùó **If you do not intend to use this functionality**, feel free to exclude this permission from your GitHub App Registration

The AppId and Private Key must be provided as environment variables to the application.
