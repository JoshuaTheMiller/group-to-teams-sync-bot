## Permissions

This bot currently requires a GitHub App Registration to have the following permissions:

```yaml
repository:contents: Read-only
repository:deployments: Read-and-write # Under review for removal
repository:metadata: Read-only

organization:administration: Read-and-write # See note about Organization Administration Note below

# Upcoming
repository:checks: Read-and-write
repository:commit-statuses: Read-and-write
repository:pull-requests: Read

```

## Organization Administration Note

* This permission is needed for managing [Security Managers](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/orgs/security-managers?apiVersion=2022-11-28), though as Security Managers is in beta, this permission may also change.
